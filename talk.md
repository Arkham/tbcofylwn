# Oh, No.

# So what's the point?

# The Point™

1. As a user of a smart device, you have literally no control over what it does.
2. No matter how well intentioned you think the maker is.
3. One day they will get acquired.
4. If you're lucky, all your data will be sold.
4. If you're unlucky, your device will be bricked.

# What's the alternative?

[.header: text-scale(10.0)]

# DIY

---

# The only way trust a smart device is to know exactly what it does.

---

# And the only way to do that is to build it yourself.

---

# No, there is no other way.

---

# I know. It's takes time and effort to become a circuit whisperer.

---

# But as engineers we are in a TRULY privileged position to fight back.

# My First World Problem

1. Go to the kitchen and fill up the moka.
2. Put it on the stove on a low setting.
3. Go back to my office to work on some stuff.
4. Keep doors open so I can hear the rumbling.
5. Get distracted.
6. Run to the kitchen when it's too late.
7. Burnt coffee 😿

---

# But.. What if I built a machine which tells me when the coffee is ready?
